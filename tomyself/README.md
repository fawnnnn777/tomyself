This is Diego Rojas, I’m from Guatemala! And my project’s title is ‘to myself’
This is a web application I built to be able to post your thoughts, it’s like a blog! 

I had a different idea in mind when I started this final project. The ideas was to create a uber-eats-kind of app but for small businesses around my neighborhood. This was a really good idea but as I continued to work on the app I started to realize it was going to be bigger than I thought.

I heard many great things about flask but I also heard that if you wanted to build a big app, you should start working on django. So I decided to look for information on that and I changed the whole idea. Since django is something new for me, I decided that I was going to go a little smaller. 

The idea of the blog came from my addiction to social media and from reading the book of ‘meditations’ by Marcus Aurelious. I realize I was kind of tired of the short-content format like stories and reels and tik toks, so I needed to do the opposite which is a tiny blog for me and my friends where you can post your thoughts and people can like those posts. 

It’s not the most ambitious thing but it’s definitely a challenge since I started using django instead of flask. 

Now, to explain some of the files you can find here, let’s start with something that really was a big change. Models.py. This is a big change since I think this is way different from just using python.execute to change, add, and delete data from the database. 

Following models.py, I would like to talk about the template design. I chose this palette of colors to honor the inspiration of the app which is the book ‘meditations’, which as you can see it’s red and black. 

After that, let’s talk about Javascript. After that last lectures, I realized the power of javascript so I decided to use a little bit of javascript as you can see in blog.js. I used it for minimal things, and to make the website a bit interactive and make it smaller since instead of having a new template to update your bio, I’m using just javascript to change the html.
